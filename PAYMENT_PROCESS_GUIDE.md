### 3. Fund Security

/balance                    # View current escrow status
/txid <transaction_hash>   # Submit transaction hash manually

# Admin intervention
/dispute                   # Open dispute for manual review
```

#### Release Failures
**Symptoms**: `/release` command fails or shows error
**Causes**:
- Seller wallet address invalid

/dispute                   # Request manual release
```

#### Address Generation Failures
**Symptoms**: No escrow address generated after both parties set wallets
**Causes**:
